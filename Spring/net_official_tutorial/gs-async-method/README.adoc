This guide walks you through the steps to create asynchronous queries to Facebook. The focus is on the asynchronous part, a feature often used when scaling services.

== What you'll build

You'll build a lookup service that queries Facebook pages and retrieve data through Facebook's Graph API. One approach to scaling services is to run expensive jobs in the background and wait for the results using Java's {Future}[`Future`] interface. Java's `Future` is essentially a container housed to hold the potential results. It gives you methods to let you poll if the results have arrived yet, and when they have, the ability to access the results.

== Create a representation of a page

Before you can create a Facebook lookup service, you need to define a representation for the data you'll retrieve through Facebook's Graph API.

To model the page representation, you create a resource representation class. Provide a plain old Java object with fields, constructors, and accessors for the `id` and `content` data:

`src/main/java/hello/Page.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Page.java[]
----

Spring uses the {jackson}[Jackson JSON] library to convert Facebook's JSON response into a `Page` object. The `@JsonIgnoreProperties` annotation signals Spring to ignore any attributes not listed in the class. This makes it easy to make REST calls and produce domain objects.

In this guide, we are only grabbing the `id` and the `content` for demonstration purposes.


== Create a Facebook lookup service

Next you need to create a service that queries Facebook to find pages.

`src/main/java/hello/FacebookLookupService.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/FacebookLookupService.java[]
----
    
The `FacebookLookupService` class uses Spring's `RestTemplate` to invoke a remote REST point (graph.facebook.com), and then convert the answer into a `Page` object.

The class is marked with the `@Service` annotation, making it a candidate for Spring's component scanning to detect it and add it to the link:/understanding/application-context[application context].

The `findPage` method is flagged with Spring's `@Async` annotation, indicating it will run on a separate thread. The method's return type is {Future}[`Future<Page>`] instead of `Page`, a requirement for any asynchronous service. This code uses the concrete implementation of `AsyncResult` to wrap the results of the Facebook query.

NOTE: Creating a local instance of the `FacebookLookupService` class does NOT allow the `findPage` method to run asynchronously. It must be created inside a `@Configuration` class or picked up by `@ComponentScan`.

The timing for Facebook's Graph API can vary widely. To demonstrate the benefits later in this guide, an extra delay of one second has been added to this service.

== Make the application executable

To run a sample, you can create an executable jar. Spring's `@Async` annotation works with web apps, but you don't need all the extra steps of setting up a web container to see its benefits.


`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

The `main()` method defers to the {SpringApplication}[`SpringApplication`] helper class, providing `Application.class` as an argument to its `run()` method. This tells Spring to read the annotation metadata from `Application` and to manage it as a component in the link:/understanding/application-context[Spring application context].

The `@ComponentScan` annotation tells Spring to search recursively through the `hello` package and its children for classes marked directly or indirectly with Spring's {Component}[`@Component`] annotation. This directive ensures that Spring finds and registers the `FacebookLookupService`, because it is marked with `@Service`, which in turn is a kind of `@Component` annotation.

The {EnableAsync}[`@EnableAsync`] annotation switches on Spring's ability to run `@Async` methods in a background thread pool.

The {EnableAutoConfiguration}[`@EnableAutoConfiguration`] annotation switches on reasonable default behaviors based on the content of your classpath. For example, it looks for any class that implements the `CommandLineRunner` interface and invokes its `run()` method. In this case, it runs the demo code for this guide.

Logging output is displayed, showing each query to Facebook. Each `Future` result is monitored until available, so when they are all done, the log will print out the results along with the total amount of elapsed time.

To compare how long this takes without the asynchronous feature, try commenting out the `@Async` annotation and run the service again. The total elapsed time should increase noticeably because each query takes at least a second.

Essentially, the longer the task takes and the more tasks are invoked simultaneously, the more benefit you will see with making things asynchronous. The trade off is handling the `Future` interface. It adds a layer of indirection because you are no longer dealing directly with the results, but must instead poll for them. If multiple method calls were previously chained together in a synchronous fashion, converting to an asynchronous approach may require synchronizing results. But this extra work may be necessary if asynchronous method calls solves a critical scaling issue.


== Summary

Congratulations! You've just developed an asynchronous service that lets you scale multiple calls at once.
