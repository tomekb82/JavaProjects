    Handle CRUD for an item (weâ€™re going to use bears)
    Have a standard URL (http://example.com/api/bears and http://example.com/api/bears/:bear_id)
    Use the proper HTTP verbs to make it RESTful (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE)
    Return JSON data
    Log all requests to the console

Postman in google chrome used for debug REST purposes
