  <!--
  This snippet uses Tapestry's If component. 
  The If component evaluates its test parameter and, 
  if the value evaluates to true, renders its body. 
  The property bound to test doesn't have to be a boolean; 
  Tapestry treats null as false, it treats zero as false 
  and non-zero as true, it treats an empty Collection as false ... 
  and for Strings (such as message) it treats a blank string 
  (one that is null, or consists only of white space) as false, 
  and a non-blank string is true.
